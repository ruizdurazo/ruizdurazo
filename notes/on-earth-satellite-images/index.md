## Intro

Some people think that urban, industrial, and human landscapes are ugly, vile aberrations against the pure, perfect, and innocent Mother Nature.

I disagree.

## Rural

### Crop Circles

These are center-pivot irrigation farms, but I prefer to call them **_crop circles_**. They do look alien, after all.

**Middle East**

**Middle of nowhere, South-western Egypt**

Farms out in the middle of nowhere in the Saharan Desert / Al Wadi Al Aadid Desert.

## Industrial

### Oil & Gas

<!-- The world runs on carbon and petrochemicals. We'll need oil and gas (methane) forever. Not necessarily to power the world (though they still do), but because we need them for plastics, fertilizer, medicines, and more. -->

<!-- --- -->

**Middle East**

**Aramco Khurais Complex, Saudi Arabia**

The Arabian Desert is dotted with many, many oil complexes like this one.
