## Intro

A few years ago, I started to read more books. ðŸ“š

Reading is cool. When I read, I can be inspired, surprised, mind-blown.

If you're reading this, then you probably like to read too. And maybe youâ€™re reading some great book right now. Perhaps the ideas in the book are truly life-changing. Or perhaps the story is so good you almost can't put the book down.

In any case, you might be thinking that it's so good that you'll never forget it.

Rookie mistake.

I thought I'd never forget either. But, of course, I eventually had to admit to myself that I'm only human. I've forgotten a ton of material that I've read.

The mistake? I simply read the books.

Once I finished them, I put them down, moved on, and, eventually, I inevitably forgot most of those great ideas and insights.

When I realized that this was happening, it made me really frustrated and a bit sad. So I decided to completely change the way I read.

Now, Iâ€™ve landed on a system that helps me remember what Iâ€™ve read. It's quite simple, but very effective.

It helps me catalog all the great lessons from these great books, and now I have a place where I can easily find them and go through them from time to time.

There are 5 levels to get there.

## Levels

There are basically 5 levels of reading:

1. **Just reading**
2. **Adding highlights**
3. **Reviewing the highlights**
4. **Creating a collection of all your highlights**
5. **Writing your own notes and summaries**

The levels are cumulative and interconnected. Meaning, in each level you need to do what that level says, plus what all the previous ones say as well.

### Level 1: Just reading

Most people donâ€™t read books. And most of the few who do, stay at this level. Meaning they only read the book once, and inevitably forget about it.

This level is easy enough to understand, so letâ€™s just move on to the next.

### Level 2: Adding highlights

At this level, you read the book, but you also ==start adding highlights==.

The highlights can take any shape. Whether itâ€™s literally using a highlight marker on the book, or underlining with a pen or pencil, or highlighting an e-book. It doesnâ€™t matter. What matters is that you do it.

Me? I like to add them in the Kindle app on my iPad mini if itâ€™s an e-book, and use post-its if itâ€™s a physical book.

But if you simply do this, youâ€™ll still forget! So letâ€™s go to the next level.

### Level 3: Reviewing your highlights

Here, you have your highlights and you review them and reread them!

It can help you to speed-read a book, focusing on the parts that you found most interesting, entertaining, or thought-provoking.

Itâ€™s really cool because you can:

- quickly pick up any book in your library,
- flip through until you find one of your highlights,
- and be delightfully surprised by finding a great passage or insight.

Itâ€™s a really nice way to rediscover the books in your library, or even a fun way to start a conversation: just pick up a book, flip through, and see what highlighted excerpt you can start discussing!

But it might be tedious to do this (looking for a book and then looking for a highlight), and you might _still_ forget!

### Level 4: Creating a collection of highlights

Here, you start saving all your highlights in one place, and start creating a collection of highlights.

Nowadays, you can easily add your highlights with any one of the many reading or note-taking tools: [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), Apple Notes, [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). It doesnâ€™t matter what you use. What matters is that you create your collection and use it.

Me? I use [Notion](https://www.notion.com/).

Having a collection of highlights is cool because not only do you have them all in one place and potentially with you at all times, but because you can quickly switch through entire books, group them, search for keywords, etc.

Itâ€™s a bit more work, but it pays off.

But thereâ€™s still something missing. Even at this level, the effort has been quite passive. This is when youâ€™re ready to reach the final level.

### Level 5: Writing your own notes and summaries

This is the god level.

And yet, the only thing you're doing is reading, taking a minute to mark the location of an interesting quote (or idea, or passage), and then adding a few more notes to paraphrase, summarize, or make a link to other thoughts and references that come to mind.

Thatâ€™s it. You basically just add some notes and summaries in your own words.

But it makes a huge difference because now, not only are you passively consuming the information, you are using it and compressing it using your own vocabulary.

But be careful:

> quote
>
> Many people make the mistake of going overboard with note-taking, and end up losing the joy of reading by turning it into a tedious process.
>
> byline
> Anne-Laure Le Cunff

Note taking doesnâ€™t have to be insanely complicated.

Here are some examples of what you can add in your notes:

- Add a short summary in your own words.
- Add a note explaining why you found a highlight interesting, funny, or enraging.
- Add references (or links) to other books and ideas you were reminded of.
- Point out the stuff you didn't like, donâ€™t agree with, or donâ€™t understand.

And keep it simple!!

- **Bonus points** if you're able to write your notes and summaries using very simple words.
- **Extra bonus points** if you can write those being concise, yet complete.

In short, **if you canâ€™t explain it simply, you simply donâ€™t understand it**.

The end result is that you'll have a great document containing everything that you found interesting or relevant from the book, and if you come back to your notes every now and then, you'll never forget what you've read ever again (spaced repetition). ðŸ§ 

## How I Read IRL

If you want a real world example, here's how I do it:

1. **Read**. I like to read on the Kindle app on my iPad mini. And I mostly read in the morning. For some 15-30 minutes. And I try to do this daily. I also usually use Kindle + Audible simultaneously (yes, I buy both if both are available, reading and listening at the same time helps me focus).
2. **Highlight**. While reading, if anything interesting comes up, Iâ€™ll highlight it. If needed, Iâ€™ll add a quick note or comment (Kindle makes this easy) of why I found it interesting, any other ideas that come to mind, or why I disagree. Then, I continue reading.
3. **Copy & Write**. When I finish the book, I'll eventually take about an hour to review the highlights on Kindle, Iâ€™ll copy them to Notion and add them to the physical book using post-its as well. In Notion Iâ€™ll make like a short summary and review, and sometimes (not always) Iâ€™ll add some more notes or commentary to tie everything together.
4. **Review**. Every now and then Iâ€™ll go back to the notes in Notion and quickly review them. Or simply pick out a book in my library and speed-read it by looking for the highlights.

Of course, this is all very personal. This works for me, and might not for you. Perhaps you read at a different time of day, or use different tools. Thatâ€™s fine. The system is flexible to accommodate all of us (all of our tools and all of our reading preferences).

Just make sure to take the time to read, add your markings, collect them, and write your notes. You'll be all the wiser for doing so.

But never forget:
